Homework 6 - Reflection

In the previous work, we worked with a lot of personal and private data, whether it was vendor information or customer information. When working on previous homework, I would make a few adjustments to include ethics and inequity components. These adjustments would ensure that the data is being handled properly, and the database when not being used is locked to ensure privacy of each customer. 

In addition, I would try to make sure all the codes that I worked on didnt have data bias, where it can lead to discriminatory outcomes. I would go back and check to see if there was an bais in my code, and if there was, then I would edit my code. All the queries I work with should have an element of fairness and avoid bias on race, gender, and other factors.

I would also be mindful not to use the data for personal use, and investigate any personal or private information of customers and vendors for any personal use. The database should be used for running queries and extracting information for an outcome, not for personal use. If at any time I come across information that I may have a conflict of interest, I would immediately take accountability and rectify the situation. I would ethical practices and avoid any inequity practices by strictly using the data for work and work related inquiries.

The best practice when working on data is access control and transparency. Access control will control the amount of users having access to the data and limit privacy breaches or misuse of information. By only allowing a few people to have access to databases and private information we can safeguard data. Furthermore, transparency in data flow, and access policies will help users understand how their data is used, and will increase confidence and will allow companies to have stricter policies in handling and storing data. 

All of these components will allow me to use ethical practices when working with any database and avoid an inequality of use of data for any personal use. Given that we had a database with lots of different information, I would have used these practices when working on my homework and assignment.
